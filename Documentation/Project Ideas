From data.world/datasets/flu
Using data from 2020's flu season, we create charts advocating for governments and corporations 
to encourage and incentivize wearing masks and mass vaccination during flu season. 
In an average year the flu kills a lot more people, due to covid precautions flu deaths were significantly
less than average. Through use of graphs comparing normal years to 2020, we hope for people to see
the benefits of seasonal mask wearing and increased vaccination use.
