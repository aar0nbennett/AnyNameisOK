Tanim&#39;s Idea

**Dataset Source** - [https://github.com/BroadbandNow/Open-Data](https://github.com/BroadbandNow/Open-Data)

The dataset from BroadbandNow contains information about the number of different isps categorized by wired (DSL, Cable, Fiber) and fixed wireless for each zip code in the United States. It also contains information about available plans in two speed ranges 25mbps and 100mbps as well as the average and 90% percentile internet speeds by zip code. For each zip code the lowest price plan that offers 25mbps speed is also listed.

**Customers** -

- People looking to move to a new location who use the internet in their daily lives

**Problem** - The problem that this project solves is the lack of information about broadband availability and speeds when trying to find a new place to move to. Broadband Finder seeks to fill in that information gap.

**Product Vision** - Our product Broadband Finder is for people who want to move but don&#39;t know if they can get the internet speeds that they want in their new home. Broadband Finder is a website that can show internet speeds a user can expect in their new location. Unlike the FCC broadband map, we can provide users recommendations of what speeds they need in order to accomplish different tasks from web browsing to streaming video.

**Major Features** -

- Find number of isps (if any) in a zip code
- Find average internet speed in a zip code
- Find highest average internet speed in a zip code
- Show cost of cheapest plan with 25mbps minimum speed
- Provide list of internet-based tasks (web browsing, streaming, etc.) that can be accomplished at a given internet speed

Tom&#39;s Idea

**Dataset Source** - [https://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs\_laboratory/flunet/en/](https://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/flunet/en/)

The dataset from the World Health Organization contains information from the influenza surveillance laboratory sorted by week, month or year. The dataset contains the types of influenza that are being tested for alongside comparing positive and negative flu tests.

**Customers** -

- People who want to advocate for wearing masks, mass flu vaccination, and social distancing during the flu season.

**Problem** - Every year on average 40,000+ people die of the flu or flu related complications. During the 2020-2021 flu season many fewer people died than average. Meaning that many flu deaths can be prevented with the right precautions.

**Product Vision** - Our product Flu Advisor shows how people can help preventable flu deaths on a yearly basis. The product will show how 2020-2021 resulted in fewer flu deaths because of my smart policies and legislation. The goal is to spark a social movement in which people wear masks, get the flu vaccine, and avoid unnecessary social gatherings during flu season.

**Major Features** -

- Charts the 2020 flu season compared to average flu seasons
- Updates the user on local flu numbers
- Updates the user on flu vaccine availability
- Includes number and email of legislators to encourage mask use

Mason&#39;s Idea

**Dataset:** [https://](https://epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data)[epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data](https://epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data)

The Dataset provides information categorized by location (State, City, County) in reference to air quality.

**Customer:**

People concerned about the environment, Governments and environmental organizations.

**Problem Solved:**

To address climate change and unclean air. Relates the data about air quality to known climate policy, quarantine ordinances as well as the temporary shut down of some larger polluters (factories, farms, coal, etc) Also can be used to raise awareness about the importance of air pollution.

**Product Vision:** The project would lay out a visualization of how small changes can quickly lead to large results. Demonstrating at what time periods the air quality of major cities improved relating to things like large businesses not working at full capacity and lock down measures being implemented. Users will be able to search specific states, counties and cities as well as specific dates.

**Major Features:**

- Find daily, weekly and monthly rolling air quality averages in users selected areas.
- Inform users about the impact of certain levels of poor air quality.
- Alert users when air quality is particularly bad.

Aaron&#39;s Idea

**Source:** UNICEF/WHO

**Dataset:** UNICEF/WHO Joint-Programme for monitoring water supply; Drinking water, sanitation and hygiene in health care facilities by country([https://data.unicef.org/resources/dataset/drinking-water-sanitation-hygiene-database/](https://data.unicef.org/resources/dataset/drinking-water-sanitation-hygiene-database/))

**Customer:** UN and Country Governments

**Problem solved:** To help solve and pinpoint where water is needed in countries and what countries need it so that those citizens can get water.

**Product Vision:** HydrateData (name work in progress) is a data analytics displayer that puts data found from the UNICEF/WHO Joint-Programme for monitoring water supply to put this data in a visual frame. Unlike the dataset with this product you will be able to visualize and interpret the data better. Also it will allow customers to follow trends of water in countries. It will benefit our society as a whole by allowing our governing bodies to visualize the water crisis and act accordingly to help its citizens. For this product it&#39;s about helping visualize the water crisis so everyone has access to clean water.

**Major Features:**

- Display water supply trends in participating countries
- Alert countries when water supply drops below a threshold
- Color code the graph and show when it is too low off colors
- Be able to click on a specific country and expand their data to be in more specific groups
